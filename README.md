# Colour

A prototype game made for Windows & Mac where the player can interact with the environment by grabbing colored objects and painting the environment with that color. Built by a team of Cheyenne Goddard, Claudio Vertemara, Maria Carillo, Mike Burns, & Rick Rivera. This game was made as our final project for CST 321 - Game Design I.
